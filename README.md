A simple android game using surfaceview

The game is tutorial from edu4java (http://www.edu4java.com/en/androidgame/androidgame1.html)

I add some features, like :
- random generator of bad and good guy
- background, using drawPoint
- and add scream audio, i download the audio from shockwave-sound (http://www.shockwave-sound.com/sound-effects/scream_sounds.html) 
- custom bar, which has three members, those are total-angel, time and number-evil


I am using Android Studio to develop this game
